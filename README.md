# Archival Fast Lane

## How to read this guide?

This guide is meant to serve both as a quick reference on specific archival topics and as essential reading for anyone interested in physical or digital archiving. The topics are a mix of guides, checklists and reference material.

Almost all the topics can be read in any order. Prerequisites and references are provided as and when needed. The recommended reading order is to first understand all the topics listed under **Basic Concepts** and then proceed with specific guides as needed.

Note that a few process related checklists might need proper adaptation before they can be incorporated into your workflow. Think of these as suggestions rather than inflexible rules.
