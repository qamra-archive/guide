# Archive Policy

## Introduction

Archive Policy document is a collection of fundamental guidelines around which the archive takes shape. The policy decides what becomes a part of the archive, what is rejected or stalled for inclusion, access methods and access type and other such key decisions. The policy document, therefore, **IS** the archive.

_Please note that this is a living document. Our archival policy is expected to evolve as the archive evolves with the inclusion of new material or evaluation of material that comes under consideration for inclusion. This document is supposed to give an overview only. For the complete archival policy please follow_ [_this link_](http://todo.todo)_._

### QAMRA Mandate

QAMRA aims to aid in telling the story of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Tran, Intersex, Queer \(LGBTQ+\) people of India. We are committed to collecting, preserving and making available materials that have historical, political, legal relevance to the lives of the LGBTQ+ people of India. 

## Acquisitions 

### Material Acquired

The relevance of the material under consideration for acquisition is established on a case-to-case basis. Any item or collection that contributes towards the legal, social, political, historical or cultural enrichment of the community is considered for inclusion. 

### Subject Focus

Material that is created by, or for use of the LGBTQ+ people of India is acquired. This could include a range of different material from personal histories of people involved in the sociopolitical struggle, material instrumental in expanding the body of rights of the LGBTQ+ people of India to artifacts that give a glimpse of the queer culture formed as a result of discrimination and dissent.

### Types of Material Acquired

QAMRA is a multi-media archive. Our archival interests include: personal and organizational records, books, periodicals, newspapers, photographic materials, audio/visual materials \(film, videos, DVDs, audiotapes, CDs\), press clippings, posters, flyers, artifacts, and electronic media. Material in any format may be acquired so long as it can be accommodated and preserved. Very large items and fragile items such as certain textiles may not be acquired.
