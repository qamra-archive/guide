# Add Your Collection To The Archive

So, you have a collection of items preserved over years of moving places, cat attacks and termite wars and you have come to the conclusion that this material can enable a larger community if \(selective\) access to it is made available. Almost all archives find their beginning in such independent treasures. This page will give an outline of steps that can be taken to convert your independent collection into an archive for the community.
